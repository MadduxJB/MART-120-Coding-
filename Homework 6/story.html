	<h1>Story</h1> 

	<h3>With it being the start of the Holiday Season, this seemed fitting.</h3>
		
<h5> "Twas a long time ago, longer now then it seems, in a place that perhaps you have seen in your dreams."</h5>
<h5> "For the story you are about to be told, took place is the holiday worlds of old."</h5>
<h5>"Now, you've probably wondered where holidays come from. If you haven't, I'd say its time you begun."</h5>
	<p>If you don't recognize this quote, it is from the movie Nightmare Before Christmas, and I will give a short summery of the story here. With some spoilers, so be warned. It tells the story of Jack, the Pumpkin King, who lives in Halloween town. He is always praised, and is deeply loved by the other citizens. However, since he has been living the same life for so long, he starts to get tired of the same thing, year after year. After a Halloween celebration, one he would've done many time, he just wanders off. In doing this, he finds a circle of trees, with different holiday symbols on them. He ends up going though one that is clearly related to Christmas. Sure enough, it transports him to the North Pole. And he is blown away! He loves what he sees! When he gets back to Halloween town, after trying to explain it to the towns folk, he figures, why not do it himself. Why cant HE just take over Christmas? After he sends people to kidnap Santa Clause, and he fills the role, he realizes the error of his ways, saves Santa from the Evil Ogey Bogey man he unintentionally left him with, and Christmas is saved. Its a character study about Jack, its a Musical, its a Halloween movie, a Christmas movie, and its just an all around great movie! I highly recommend checking it out! </p>
